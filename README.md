# Jacket
Jacket is a health tracking app designed specifically for strength athletes, be they bodybuilders, powerlifters, strongmen, et al.

## Vision
* Keep track of the metrics that matter most to the athlete. 
	* Visualize health and fitness data in a way that's lovely to read and fun to explore.
* Offer athletes an intuitive and non-restrictive way to journal what they eat, lift, and do. 
	* Remove uncertainty about what food choices to make and about how to log training sessions.

This project is just getting started; check back for more soon!
