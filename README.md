# Jacket
Jacket is a health tracking app designed specifically for strength athletes, be they bodybuilders, powerlifters, strongmen, et al.

## Vision
### Keep track of the metrics that matter most to the athlete. 
* Visualize health and fitness data in a way that's lovely to read and fun to explore.

### Offer athletes an intuitive and non-restrictive way to journal what they eat, lift, and do. 
* Remove uncertainty about what food choices to make and about how to log training sessions.
* During workouts, only worry about the information that matters. Which exercise am I on? What set am I on? How many am I doing?
* Get rid of the idea that exercise tracking through an app is just a glorified spreadsheet.
	* Offer an intuitive graphical way for both athletes and coaches to set up their training sessions.
